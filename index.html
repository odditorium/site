        <p>
          Making cross-platform apps and websites is no easy job, so we take pride in our work and do it the best we can.
        </p>

        <p>
          We started out in the height of COVID-19, we decided to make use of our skills and share them with others to help them get their projects done.
        </p>

        <p>
          We are no stranger to big projects, I mean, look at this site, its pretty cool right?

        <p>
          We can make you a full ecommerce store, or a small blog, you decide. We use Node.JS or Deno, per buyer preference of courese. It can use React or Angular, but if you pick react we can do more. We build most of our site using a mix of tailwindcss and three.js, depending, once again, on buyer preference.
        </p>
        <a href="https://buy.stripe.com/eVabMz1id5JmbhmaEE">Desktop App Dev</a>
        <p>
          We currently only support Windows/Linux, but plan to support MacOS in the future. We can build you a multi-platform desktop app that suits your needs using React Native, PyQT5, or JavaFX. We also support in-app purchases and dynamic updates, so you can serve your updates from a webserver and have them immediately be pushed onto the user client with ease. 
        </p>
        <a href="https://not.available">Mobile Dev</a>
        <p>
          Our mobile applications are not ready for sale yet, because while we know how to make the basic things, we don't want to sell you a app that does not fufill your needs.
